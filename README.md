## Description

The original **EcoFloc** is a comprehensive and versatile tool developed by the R&D laboratory of Technopôle Domolandes[^1], supported by Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour and Université de Toulouse.

**EcoFloc4Win** is a port of this tool made to work for Windows operating systems is developped by a team of developpers at the IUT de Bayonne et du Pays-Basque[^2]. It was made to be as simple to install and use as possible while keeping

**EcoFloc4Win** measures the energy consumption of applications in Windows environments across several hardware components. In this beta release, it enables energy measurement for the **CPU**, **GPU**, **storage devices (SD)**, and **network interface controllers (NIC)**. The tool measures energy at predefined intervals during a specified timeout, allowing users to create detailed energy profiles based on hardware components and behavioral patterns over time.

### Power calculation

**EcoFloc** calculates the energy consumption for each hardware component based on the load generated by running processes, identified by their **PID**. It utilizes load and energy data sourced from **GNU/Linux kernel** interfaces or, if unavailable, from the hardware components' specifications (datasheets), which can be either predefined or customized

### Limitations

It is important to note that, like any software tool measuring hardware energy consumption, EcoFloc's results are approximations and should not be considered absolutely precise.

As of the beta release **Ecofloc4Win** is unable to obtain the power consumption for the **RAM** due to the way Windows interacts with memory management while running programs.

## Technical Specifications

In this beta version of **EcoFloc4Win**, each hardware component—CPU, SD, GPU, and NIC—is managed by a json file that specifies what are the specifications of your components. You can find and modify the json files in named after each components or alternatively you can use EcoflocConfigurator.exe to modify these configurations for you.


### General System Requirements

**EcoFloc4Win** requires Windows 10 or above for the base applications.
The Web-UI requires node and npm.
EcoflocConfigurator.exe requires .NET desktop runtime applications version 8.0.10.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install **EcoFloc4Win**:

1. **Download the software**: 
   - Clone the repository or download the latest release from [GitHub](github path to the repo).
2. **Install prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed for the Web-UI. Download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Install the .NET Desktop Runtime (version 8.0.10). Download it from [Microsoft .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
3. **Run the installer**:
   - Execute `(name of the installer)` and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. **Configure hardware specifications**:
   - Use `EcoflocConfigurator.exe` to customize hardware configurations or manually edit the JSON files in the `config/` directory.

## Usage Guide

Once installed, follow these steps to use **EcoFloc4Win**:

1. **Start the application**:
   - Open a command prompt as administrator, navigate to the installation directory, and run `EcoFloc.exe`.
2. **Measure energy consumption**:
   - Specify the hardware components to monitor using command-line arguments, for example:
     ```bash
     EcoFloc.exe --components CPU,GPU --interval 5 --timeout 60 (à voir avec Mattis)
     ```
   - This command measures CPU and GPU energy consumption every 5 seconds for 60 seconds.
3. **View results**:
   - The results will be saved as a JSON or CSV file in the `results/` directory.
4. **Web-UI** (optional):
   - Launch the Web-UI with the executable `(put executable file name)`
---

## Configuration Guide

Customize **EcoFloc4Win** settings to match your hardware specifications:

1. **Using EcoflocConfigurator.exe**:
   - Launch `EcoflocConfigurator.exe`.
   - Select the component you wish to configure (CPU, GPU, SD, or NIC).
   - Enter the required specifications (e.g., power consumption in Watts) and save your changes.

2. **Manually editing JSON files**:
   - Navigate to the `config/` directory.
   - Open the JSON file corresponding to the component you want to configure (e.g., `cpu.json`).
   - Update the specifications based on your hardware datasheets. For example:
     ```json
     {
       (add the exemple of the config file)
     }
     ```
