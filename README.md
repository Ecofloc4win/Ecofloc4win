## Description

The original **EcoFloc** is a comprehensive and versatile tool developed by the R&D laboratory of Technopôle Domolandes[^1], supported by Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour and Université de Toulouse.

**EcoFloc4Win** is a port of this tool made to work for Windows operating systems is developped by a team of developpers at the IUT de Bayonne et du Pays-Basque[^2]. It was made to be as simple to install and use as possible while keeping

**EcoFloc4Win** measures the energy consumption of applications in Windows environments across several hardware components. In this beta release, it enables energy measurement for the **CPU**, **GPU**, **storage devices (SD)**, and **network interface controllers (NIC)**. The tool measures energy at predefined intervals during a specified timeout, allowing users to create detailed energy profiles based on hardware components and behavioral patterns over time.

### Power calculation

**EcoFloc** calculates the energy consumption for each hardware component based on the load generated by running processes, identified by their **PID**. It utilizes load and energy data sourced from **GNU/Linux kernel** interfaces or, if unavailable, from the hardware components' specifications (datasheets), which can be either predefined or customized

### Limitations

It is important to note that, like any software tool measuring hardware energy consumption, EcoFloc's results are approximations and should not be considered absolutely precise.

As of the beta release **Ecofloc4Win** is unable to obtain the power consumption for the **RAM** due to the way Windows interacts with memory management while running programs.

## Technical Specifications

In this beta version of **EcoFloc4Win**, each hardware component—CPU, SD, GPU, and NIC—is managed by a json file that specifies what are the specifications of your components. You can find and modify the json files in named after each components or alternatively you can use EcoflocConfigurator.exe to modify these configurations for you.


### General System Requirements

**EcoFloc4Win** requires Windows 10 or above for the base applications.
The Web-UI requires node and npm.
EcoflocConfigurator.exe requires .NET desktop runtime applications version 8.0.10.
