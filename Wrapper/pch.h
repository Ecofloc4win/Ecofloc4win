 * @brief This is a precompiled header file.
 *        The files listed below are compiled only once, which improves generation performance of future builds.
 *        This also affects IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many code navigation features.
 *        However, the files listed here are ALL recompiled if any of them are updated between builds.
 *        Do not add frequently updated files here, as this negates performance gains.
